    body: '<p>There\'s a term in psychology called attribution error. This means if something goes wrong, and that makes you think negatively about yourself, you think the negative thought is true about lots of things in your life, and it\'s going to be true forever.</p><p>For example, if your boss calls you stupid for making a mistake, you think "I\'m a stupid person, and everyone will always think I\'m stupid." While someone with higher self-esteem might think, "that was a stupid mistake, but normally I\'m good at my job, and my boss likes to bully people so I shouldn\'t take it personally."<p>',

    body: '<p>Internal means you interpret an event or criticism as being about yourself and the things that make you \'you\', even if it is more to do with an external event -- meaning something that has nothing to do with you.</p><p>For example, if you fail an exam, you might think, “I\'m stupid,” instead of “that was a really hard exam that most people would struggle with.”</p><p>Thinking you\'re stupid would mean that you\'re blaming only your own abilities, while considering how hard the exam was would mean you\'re able to see other reasons things didn\'t go well. If you\'re able to look at other reasons, you\'re less likely to put yourself down.</p>',

It is normal to be better at some things than others, and have good days and bad days even with things you are really good at.
