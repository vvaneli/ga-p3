## Techonology

MERN stack:
* React
* Express
* Node JS
* MongoDB
* SCSS

## Brief (student project)
Build a full stack application and deploy it online. Requirements include:
* Use an Express API to serve your data from a Mongo database.
* Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React.
* Thoughtful user stories and wireframes.
* Visually impressive design.

### Timeframe & Team
Worked solo over 1 week

## Planning

### Background research
I researched anxieties experienced by developers and mental health solutions from the National Health Service.

Sort testimonials into categories:

## Build/Code Process

I used npm to set up express, nodemon, morgan and dotenv. Used mongoose to connect to MongoDB. Defined a model schema and flushed it with seed data. Defined views, secured routes and tested end points. I then added the client front end in React using Vite.

I managed the build by defining user stories. Break them into tasks, then prioritised them using a kanban board:
